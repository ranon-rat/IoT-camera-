# [routes.go](https://github.com/ranon-rat/IoT-camera-/blob/master/server/routes.go)
## what is it for?

is to set the routes that the server will do, it only has a `setupRoutes ()` function which returns an error if something happens
It is not very difficult and well, you just have to put it in the main

# [types.go](https://github.com/ranon-rat/IoT-camera-/blob/master/server/types.go)

## what is it for?
It is only to put certain things and have a greater order in the structure of the project, there we put the types and other things as variables and constants and the only type that for now is the following
## register
this was made for the database
```go
type  register struct {
Password    string `json:"password"`
Username    string `json:"username"`
Image       string `json:"image"`
IP          string

}
```
# [controllers.go](https://github.com/ranon-rat/IoT-camera-/blob/master/server/controllers.go)

## what is it for?

It is a file that was made specifically to make the handler requests so you can avoid certain problems with some things

## registerUser ()

This function is made to handle requests from the `/ register` route
if you make a post request it will execute the function `registerUserCameraDatabase ()`
but then you get another answer
it is not very difficult to understand.

## loginUser ()

This function also serves to handle requests from the `login` route
If you make a post request, you should execute the `loginUserCameraDatabase ()` function, even though for now that function is not available and you should take care of that.

<!--------------------->

# [dataControl.go](https://github.com/ranon-rat/IoT-camera-/blob/master/server/dataControl.go)

## what is it for?

In this file certain operations are performed to work with the database
<!--------------------->
## getConnection ()
ok, the function with which the database connects is this
```go
func getConnection () (* sql.DB, error) {}
```
the database with which it connects is `iotcameradata.db` there in the` getConnection () `function it connects directly so you don't need to do much
<!--------------------->
## exist ()
The function `exist ()` is to be able to know if the user who has tried to register already exists so that some problems can be avoided when we register the user,
the query that executes this function is
```sql
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM usercameras
where username =? OR ip =? ; `
```
and the function is
```go
func exist (user string, ip string, sizeChan chan int) error
```
so it can return an error and must be used concurrently `go exist (" Fgh "," 127.0.0.1 ", sizeChan)`
<! --------------------->
## registerUserCameraDatabase ()

This function serves to register the user as long as it makes a post request

The query that executes this function is the following
```go
INSERT INTO
usercameras
ip,
password,
username,
last_time_login
)
VALUES (? 1,? 2,? 3,? 4)
```
There you add important information with which you can work in the future

the structure of the function is as follows
```go
func registerUserCameraDatabase (user register, errChan chan error)
```
It is made for goroutines so you should put the typical `go registerUserCameraDatabase (user, errChan)`
and with that it would be enough

## loginUserCameraDatabase ()

### what is it for?
It is a function that is made to make a login, it already works and it is quite good

### query
the query that executes this function is
```sql
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM usercameras
WHERE username =? 1 AND password =? 2;
```
### Body

the body of the function is this
```go
func loginUserCameraDatabase (user register, validChan chan bool)
```
It is recommended that you use co `go loginUserCameraDatabase` to control it since it is a function that was made specifically to log in concurrently, it returns a` true` if the query value is greater than 1
## updateUsages ()

### what is it for?
We have done this function for a simple reason ... it is to be able to update and know when was the last time you sent an image, so we can avoid some problems that usually happen

### Query
the query that executes this function is
```sql
UPDATE usercameras
SET last_time_login =? 1
WHERE username =? 2; `
```

## Body
This function is made to work in `goroutines` so it is recommended that you use it that way
```go
func updateUsages (user register)
```


<! --------------------->
## the database structure is as follows

### usercameras

| name | type |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| id | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY |
| ip | TEXT |
| password | TEXT |
| username | TEXT |
| last_time_login | INTEGER |

### userclients

| name | type |
| --- | --- |
| cookie | TEXT |

for now we have not implemented this database but it works like this
